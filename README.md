# CRM System Checklist

## Setting up the Project:

- [x] Create a new directory for your project.
- [ ] Initialize a Node.js project using `npm init`.
- [ ] Install necessary dependencies, such as Express, Mongoose, and other libraries, using `npm install`.

## Database Configuration:

- [ ] Choose a database for your CRM system (e.g., MongoDB).
- [ ] Set up a connection to the database using a MongoDB driver or an ORM like Mongoose.
- [ ] Define your data models, such as User, Customer, Lead, etc., using Mongoose schemas.

## User Authentication:

- [ ] Implement user registration and login functionality using packages like Passport.js or JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- [ ] Store user information securely in the database, including hashed passwords.

## Create Routes:

- [ ] Set up Express routes to handle various operations like creating, updating, and deleting customers, leads, etc.
- [ ] Implement authentication middleware to ensure that only authenticated users can access protected routes.

## Build Controllers:

- [ ] Create controller functions for each route to handle the business logic.
- [ ] These functions will interact with the database models to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

## Front-End Development:

- [ ] Create appropriate views using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js.
- [ ] Use AJAX or fetch API to send requests to your Express routes and display the retrieved data on the front end.

## Additional Features:

- [ ] Implement features like search functionality, sorting, filtering, pagination, etc.
- [ ] Create analytics and reporting tools to track sales, customer interactions, etc.
- [ ] Add email integration, notifications, and reminders for tasks, appointments, etc.

## Testing and Deployment:

- [ ] Write unit tests to ensure the reliability of your code.
- [ ] Deploy your CRM system to a hosting provider or a cloud platform like Heroku or AWS.
- [ ] Configure your deployment environment and set up continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines if needed.
