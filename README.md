Setting up the Project:

[x] 1. Create a new directory for your project.
[ ] 2. Initialize a Node.js project using npm init.
[ ] 3. Install necessary dependencies, such as Express, Mongoose, and other 
libraries, using npm install.

Database Configuration:

[ ] 1. Choose a database for your CRM system (e.g., MongoDB).
[ ] 2. Set up a connection to the database using a MongoDB driver or an ORM like Mongoose.
[ ] 3. Define your data models, such as User, Customer, Lead, etc., using 
Mongoose schemas.

[ ] User Authentication:

[ ] Front-End Development:

[ ] 1. Create appropriate views using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js.
[ ] 2. Use AJAX or fetch API to send requests to your Express routes and display the retrieved data on the front end.

[ ] 4. Testing and Deployment:

[ ] Write unit tests to ensure the reliability of your code.
